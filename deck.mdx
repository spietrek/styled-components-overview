# CSS

* Many developers say: “I’m a developer, I don’t care how things look!”.
* Bottom line, since they don’t care about how things look, they don’t care to learn CSS. They should.
* Developers should learn CSS to know how an application should be styled and provide responsive and accessibility support.


> __*CSS is hard. It can take years to be proficient.*__

# CSS Challenges

1. Quicky language
2. Designed for documents not apps
3. Global Namespace
4. Hardly reusable
5. Non-programmatic
6. Non-modular
7. CSS development too slow
8. Styling conflicts
9. Dead code

# Component Based Design

### Split UI into small, more manageable parts.
### React is structured around components.
### Isolating components and states allow developers to articulate behavior and functionality.
### Based on Atomic Design.

# Atomic Design ( Brad Frost)

<Appear>
  <ol>Atoms - Are the basic building blocks of matter.</ol>
  <ol>Molecules - Groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units of a compound.</ol>
  <ol>Organisms - Groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface.</ol>
  <ol>Templates - Consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched together to form pages.</ol>
  <ol>Pages - Specific instances of templates.</ol>
</Appear>

# Styling in ReactJS

* CSS Stylesheet
* Inline Styling
* CSS Modules
* CSS-in-JS

---

# CSS Stylesheet

```
import React from 'react';
import './DottedBox.css';

const DottedBox = () => (
  <div className="DottedBox">
    <p className="DottedBox_content">Get started with CSS styling</p>
  </div>
);
```

---

# Inline Styling

```
import React from 'react';

const divStyle = {
  margin: '40px',
  border: '5px solid pink'
};
const pStyle = {
  fontSize: '15px',
  textAlign: 'center'
};

const Box = () => (
  <div style={divStyle}>
    <p style={pStyle}>Get started with inline style</p>
  </div>
);

export default Box;
```

---

# CSS Modules

```
import React from 'react';
import styles from './DashedBox.css';

const DashedBox = () => (
  <div className={styles.container}>
    <p className={styles.content}>Get started with CSS Modules style</p>
  </div>
);

export default DashedBox;
```

# CSS-in-JS Benefits

1. Scoped styles without selectors. Unique class names are created to avoid collisions.
2. Avoids specificity conflicts. Two style definitions for one element can be used.
3. Source order independence. No need to worry about how the order of files is imported.
4. Dead code elimination. Linters will show unused components so they can be removed if not used.
5. Vendor prefixing. Adds vendor prefixes only for the required browser.
6. Highly expressive which makes reading JSX easier.

# styled-components Benefits

### Use as as much or as little as you want
### Use your favorite UI framework and add styled-components on top
### Defining styled components that possess their own encapsulated styles

---

> The basic idea of styled-components is to enforce best practices by removing the mapping between styles and components.
